# Frequently Asked Questions

## DORA Quick Check
### Quick Check 2023
#### What do my results mean?
Your quick check results include an overall software delivery performance score, on a a scale from 0 to 10. This blended metric is derived from the four individual metrics, which are also presented individually. Following the methodology from the [2023 Accelerate State of DevOps Report]({{< ref "/research/2023/" >}}), all scores are normalized to a 10-point scale for convenience. You can compare your results to benchmarks derived from DORA's 2023 research program.

#### What's new in the 2023 Quick Check?
In previous versions of the Quick Check, your results were displayed as a _percentile_ relative to the distribution of respondents to DORA's research survey. In response to feedback from users, the current Quick Check computes your score only based on your inputs. This facilitates comparisons across time to help your team track progress. Also in previous versions of the Quick Check, users were forced to select a single industry before submitting their metrics. In the current version, users may choose an industry comparison after submitting. This allows additional exploration: if, for example, your organization operates across multiple industries, you can compare your results with each of those industries.
