    DORA's research has consistently found that a team's software delivery capability reliably predicts the value that the team provides to their organization. Survey respondents who achieve high levels of software delivery performance report that their organizations perform better on business objectives. Performance can be assessed according to four software delivery metrics:

    _For the primary application or service you work on..._

    **Lead time for changes:** How long does it take to go from code committed to code successfully running in production?

    **Deployment frequency:** How often does your organization deploy code to production or release it to end users?

    **Change failure rate:** What percentage of changes to production or released to users result in degraded service (e.g., lead to service impairment or service outage) and subsequently require remediation (e.g., require a hotfix, rollback, fix forward, patch)?

    **Time to restore service:** How long does it generally take to restore service when a service incident or a defect that impacts users occurs (e.g., unplanned outage, service impairment)?
