# DORA's Research Program: 2023

For the last nine years, we've produced the State of DevOps report, hearing from over 36,000 professionals worldwide.

We've outlined the DevOps practices that drive successful software delivery and operational performance, with a deep focus on user-centric design in the [2023 report]({{< relref "dora-report" >}}).

Use these findings to accelerate organizational performance while reducing burnout.
