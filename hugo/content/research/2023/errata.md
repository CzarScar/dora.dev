This page lists errors and corrections to the 2023 Accelerate State of DevOps Report. To track revisions, report PDFs are stamped with a version number. The initial version of the 2023 report was `v.2023-10`. The latest version is [`v.2023-12`]({{< ref "/research/2023/dora-report" >}}).

### Errata in `v.2023-10`

**p.1** On the cover, the Sleuth logo is cut off _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.9** The Knowledge sharing stats are incorrect (Mean: 3.7; IQR: 1.7-5; Median: 7.9). They should be as follows: Mean: 6.4; IQR: 5.0-8.3; Median: 6.7 _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.25** The footnote description of "Mediation" is unspecific and would benefit from an example. It should be changed to: "Mediation is a test that evaluates possible mechanisms or pathways underlying an effect. You can say, for example, 'the data supports the hypothesis that the effect of trunk-based development on software delivery performance occurs through continuous deployment (the mediator)'. Complete mediation is when the entire effect looks to be explained through the mediator. Partial mediation is when only some of the effect is explained through the mediator." _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.65** The description of Step 3 should read "Hypothesize about potential confounds" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.71** In the footnote, the link should have destination https://doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.48.6.1467 but it is incorrectly linked to https://www.zenika.com. _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.77** The word “coach” is misspelled as "couch" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.82** The word "construct" is misspelled as "contruct" _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.87** The structural equation model for Chapter 5 contains an element: "organizational performance." This element should read "operational performance." _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_

**p.90** The heading should read “Chapter 8’s models” (plural). _[Corrected in `v.2023-12`]_
