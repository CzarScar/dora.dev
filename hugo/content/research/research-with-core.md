about: "**About this model:** DORA Core is a collection of capabilities, metrics, and outcomes that represent the most firmly-established findings from across the history and breadth of DORAâ€™s research program. Core is derived from DORA's ongoing research, including the analyses presented in our annual [Accelerate State of DevOps Reports](/publications). Core is intended to be used as a guide in practitioner contexts: it deliberately trails the research, evolving more conservatively. The concepts and relationships shown in the Core Model have been repeatedly demonstrated by our research, and have been successfully used by software engineering teams to prioritize continuous improvement. _([FAQ](/faq))_"

# DORA's Research Program
DORA is the longest running academically rigorous research investigation of its kind, using behavioral science to identify the most effective and efficient ways to develop and deliver software. Our work demonstrates the predictive relationship between a team's capabilities, the software delivery performance they achieve, and the outcomes they produce.
