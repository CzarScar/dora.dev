[![2016 State of DevOps Report](/research/2016/2016-state-of-devops-report.png)](2016-state-of-devops-report.pdf)

The 2016 State of DevOps Report reveals that high-performing organizations significantly outperform low performers in terms of IT performance and employee engagement. The report emphasizes benefits of integrating quality into every stage of development. The report also highlights the benefits of an experimental approach to product development, which involves breaking down products into smaller batches, ensuring visibility into the workflow, and actively seeking customer feedback.

The report explores the relationship between IT performance and employee engagement, emphasizing the positive correlation between high performance and employee Net Promoter Scores (eNPS). It underscores the importance of integrating security practices throughout the software development lifecycle and advocates for lean product management practices, emphasizing the value of small batches, visibility, and customer feedback.

Finally, the report provieds calculations for potential savings and discussing how these savings can be reinvested to foster innovation and drive business value. This work was later expaned in [The ROI of DevOps Transformation](/research/2020/) whitepaper.

The key findings of the report are:
* High-performing organizations significantly outperform low-performing organizations in terms of throughput, stability, and employee loyalty.
* High performers deploy code 200 times more frequently than low performers, with 2,555 times faster lead times.
* High performers have 24 times faster recovery times and three times lower change failure rates than low performers.
* High performers spend 22% less time on unplanned work and rework, allowing them to spend 29% more time on new work.
* High performers spend 50% less time remediating security issues than low performers.
* An experimental approach to product development can improve IT and organizational performance.
* Technology transformation initiatives can lead to significant cost savings for organizations.
