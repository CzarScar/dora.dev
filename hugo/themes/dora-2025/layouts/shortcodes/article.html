Update for dora-2025 theme. This shortcode is no longer used.
During the transition, it will exist in both themes, but won't 
generate any output in the new theme. This way the old content
will show with the old theme, and the new content will show 
with the new theme.

The invserse mechansim will be used to populate new content
when the new theme is used.

TODO: remove {{< article >}} tags, and this file, when the old
theme is deleted.
