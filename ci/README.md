This site is hosted on Firebase, so deployment requires a Firebase builder for Cloud Build. We use [the public community builder](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/cloud-builders-community/tree/master/firebase). It must be built and pushed into your project's Container Registry repo.

Also, a secret named `github_token` must exist in Secret Manager, which contains a GH deploy key and is accessible to the Cloud Build service account.
