Furthermore, we found no evidence to support the hypothesis that a more formal approval process is associated with lower change fail rates. However the data does support the hypothesis that introducing more approvals results in a slower process and less frequent releases of large batches, with an accompanying higher impact on the production system that is likely associated with higher levels of risk and thus higher change fail rates."
